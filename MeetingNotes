* design intuitive and functional GUI
* visualisation of multiple parameters (multidimensional representation of data) 
  - graphical, 3D, text? [maybe 3D graph + point shape + colour?]
* write the use case
* create survey for sound designers on their expectations on the GUI
  - make wireframes
  - get ethics form from moodle
  
Plan
  * find the right synthesizer 
  * find the best way of communicating btween the synth and python
  * get the ML code

Meeting
* defining sound samples - spectrogram > average in time > vector - distance between them
* main problem of the project - how to call the synthesizer
* 3D representation - linear or non-linear interpolation
* PCA
* GUI:
  - data visualisation + presets memory + crossfading (could have)
  - give the user the ability to customise data visualisation (colours, shapes, relations)?
 * remember to focus on the softdev aspect of the project

Plan
* analyse: https://github.com/akuhren/target_vector_estimation
* find weather recordings
* add more use cases - use MOSCOW
* write the first chapter of the report
* edit the synthesizer to support OSC
